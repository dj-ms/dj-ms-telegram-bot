## Purpose
<h3>
This project helps to develop microservices with Django Framework.

No more tens of apps in one project.
Separate your apps into microservices and connect them under one domain.
Every Django app can be developed and deployed separately, even by different teams.
But all of them will be under one domain and will have unified authentication.

</h3>


---
> #### Note: First of all this is simple Django project with some customizations. If you are newbie in Django, you can use this project as a template for your own projects. I'm not very cool in programming, but I have some experience in Python and Django and want to share it with you.


---
> #### Not ready for production. Will be ready with version 1.0.0
