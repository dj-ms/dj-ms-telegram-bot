# Run locally using docker compose


---
## Prerequisites

Create the `.env` file and set the environment variables according to the instructions.
[Set environment variables](set_env_vars.md).
```shell
nano .env
```


---
## Run project
> Note: when running locally, you don't need to build project while unless you change `requirements.txt`. 
> It's because local code is mounted into container so your changes are reflected immediately.

Build
```shell
docker compose build
```


---

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.core.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
